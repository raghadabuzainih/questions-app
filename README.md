# Questions App

This is a simple React application built with **Vite** where users can view and add questions dynamically.  
The project demonstrates the use of **React hooks** (`useState`, `useRef`), **components**, and **LocalStorage** for data persistence.

---

## Features
- View a list of predefined questions.
- Add a new question using a form with an alert confirmation.
- Newly added questions are stored in **LocalStorage** so they remain after refreshing the page.
- Demonstrates React concepts:
  - `useState` → to manage state and trigger re-render.
  - `useRef` → to reference DOM elements and handle form input.
  - Components structure for reusability.
